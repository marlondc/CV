## Skills

#### Communication and Empathy

As part of my role as an Optometrist I enjoyed finding out why patients were attending for an eye examination. It is important to make the patient feel comfortable enough to share their reason for visit. Over time I was able to develop these skills.


#### Determined

I am classically trained pianist, violinist and double bassist. It was and is one continuous struggle. I have noticed great similarities between learning to code and learning an instrument.

#### Problem-Solving

In my previous role, a big part was using all the relevant investigations to find the cause of the patients symptoms. I found this extremely satisfying and the skill lends itself well to debugging.

#### Tech Skills

I am aware that 12weeks is a short time, but I do feel that I have a decent grasp of programming principles, languages and frameworks.

A few projects include:

### Hobbies

- I am a classically trained musician and I enjoy pratising when I get the chance
- I am fond of some friendly sporting competition. I managed to get lots of pratice playing table tennis during my time at Makers Academy knowing it is a sort after skill in tech firms, there always seems to be table tennis available.
- I have run 2 marathons and looking to add to the list. I would say I enjoy it but there comes a point on every run where I question this passtime of mine.
- Travelling. Who doesn't?
