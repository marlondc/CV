## Marlon Date-Chong

I am a qualified optometrist that decided, with great apprehension, to embark on a coding bootcamp with Maker's Academy. I love the challenge of solving something and the feeling when it is overcome. I am not too keen on the in between, but I have come to appreciate its importance.

As a graduate of Makers Academy I have a strong desire to carry on this journey to become the best developer that I can be.


## Skills

#### Communication

As part of my role as an Optometrist I enjoyed finding out why patients were attending for an eye examination. It is important to make the patient feel comfortable enough to share their reason for visit.


#### Determined

I am classically trained pianist, violinist and double bassist. It was anything but quick or easy. There were times I considered quitting. I am very happy and grateful to my parents that I didn't.  I have noticed great similarities between learning to code and learning an instrument

#### Problem-Solving

In my previous role, a big part was using all the relevant investigations to find the cause of the patients symptoms. I found this extremely satisfying and the skill lends itself well to debugging.

#### Tech Skills

I am aware that 12weeks is a short time, but I do feel that I have a decent grasp of programming principles, languages and frameworks.

A few projects include:

Name|Description|Technologies|Testing
---|---|---
Time for an Adventure|Decision based story game|Ruby on Rails, Postgres, MySQL|Rspec, Capybara
NewsApp|Web application that displays Guardian Headlines|Node.js, Javascript|Mocha, Chai
Thermostat|A virtual thermostat application|Node.js, Javascript, JQuery|Jasmine
